    <h1>Omkar Pathak</h1>
    <p>
        This website is a work in progress, but I think it's useful to have something up. I am interested in financial markets (especially global interest rate markets), global macro trading, 
        and building robust, high-performance infrastructure. I would like to puruse a career in quantitative research, global macro trading, or software engineering. 
        In summer 2025, I will be a quantitative strategist intern at Goldman Sachs.</p>
