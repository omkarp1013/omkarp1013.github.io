            <b>Week 13</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Going all-in on statistical modeling and markets (interest rates, options, macro) over the next few weeks</li>
                <li>Started neural networks chapter in The Hundred-Page ML Book</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Trying to blaze through this as I just want a high-level overview of the field from it</li>

            <b>Week 12</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Started Market Wizards</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Questions asked could be useful if I shadow traders at any point</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Started Introduction to Statistical Learning; finished chapters 1-2 and started chapter 3</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Already have background in classification vs. regression, bias-variance, etc. from ESL chapters 1-2 were a good review</li>
                    <li>Chapter 3 seems to have some overlap with STAT420 (e.g. hypothesis testing, the t-statistic)
                    <li>More concise and better flow than ESL so far</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Found this <a href="https://www.wallstreetoasis.com/forum/hedge-fund/1st-year-macro-hf-analyst-my-macro-framework">WSO article</a> on an analyst's macro framework</li>
